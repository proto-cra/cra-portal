    <h2 id="h_1">Checking your business name and BN</h2>
    <p>The legal name that appears on your BN registration records and the nine-digit BN are both displayed at the top right of the overview page.</p>
    <details open>
      <summary>Example: Business name and BN found at the top right </summary>

    </details>
    <p>Your BN is also displayed at the top of the left-menu in the <strong>Business</strong> <span class="nowrap"><strong>number (BN)</strong></span> drop-down.</p>
    <h2 id="h_2">If you have more than one business</h2>
    <p>If you have more than one BN added in My Business Account, you can select another BN from the drop-down options at the top of the left menu.</p>
    <p><strong>The information displayed on the overview page will correspond to the BN you select.</strong></p>
    <details class="mrgn-tp-lg">
      <summary>Example: You have two businesses that each have a payroll account</summary>
      <p>If you select the BN for your first business, the overview page will display the information for that business. Select the Payroll account (RP0001) for more payroll information related to that business.</p>
      <p>If you select the BN for the second business, all the information displayed will apply to that business, including the payroll account (RP0001) information.</p>

    <h3 class="h4">If you remove all the BNs</h3>
    <p>If you remove all the BNs from the Business numbers table, a BN will no longer appear on the overview page. Therefore, no services will be available. To regain these services, add a BN by selecting the <strong>Manage business number(s)</strong>.</p>
